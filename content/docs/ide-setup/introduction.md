To build a web application you need to make architecture decisions across a range of topics. The beauty of Ruby on Rails or Django is that they make those decisions for you so you can start building your web application straight away. They also back those decisions up with great documentation.

Rust on Nails is a framework leveraging existing solutions that fulfil the needs of a full stack development. We look at each decision that needs to be made then pull in solutions and package everything up so that it works together. It's an opinionated framework and it's how Cloak was built see the Cloak Github Repo.
